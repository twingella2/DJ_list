During this session we aimed to create a music recommendation tool to help beginner DJs choose music and understand how it fits different moods. To achieve this, we started by enhancing the descriptions of various DJ Techniques in the text file DJ_Techniques.txt.

Following this, we planned on using the Spotify Web API to access comprehensive song data for our recommendation function. The steps involved in setting up the Spotify Web API include creating a Spotify account, registering an application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard, and storing the provided Client ID and Client Secret safely.

We also explained the process of authorizing the application by constructing a specific URL and visiting it to obtain an authorization code. This code is then exchanged for an access token, which can be used to make authorized requests to the Spotify Web API.
